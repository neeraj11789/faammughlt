/**
 *
 * GREEDY PROBLEM
 *
 * @LEARNING: Half of the problem is just sorting it properly
 *
 * @NOTE: Algorithm
 *
 * <p>Sort in the ascending order by the start point. If two intervals share the same start point,
 * put the longer one to be the first.
 *
 * <p>Initiate the number of non-covered intervals: count = 0.
 *
 * <p>Iterate over sorted intervals and compare end points.
 *
 * <p>If the current interval is not covered by the previous one end > prev_end, increase the number
 * of non-covered intervals. Assign the current interval to be previous for the next step.
 *
 * <p>Otherwise, the current interval is covered by the previous one. Do nothing.
 *
 * <p>Return count
